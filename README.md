# Scroll of Recall

Intended as a companion for mods like [Waystones](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/Waystones), this mod allows you to create scrolls and tomes that can be bound to a specific location. No Forge port planned.

A scroll of recall is a single-use item. Bind it to a location, then use it to recall there. When you're done, use it again to return to the place you recalled from.

The tome of recall is exactly the same, but you can use it again and again. Bind it to a location once, then you can recall and return as much as you want.
