# Scroll of Recall

Intended as a companion for mods like [Waystones](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/Waystones), this mod allows you to create scrolls and tomes that can be bound to a specific location. Use the scroll to teleport home, then use it again to return to the place you recalled from! No Forge port planned.

TODO:

- Add a short teleportation cooldown
- Test thoroughly
