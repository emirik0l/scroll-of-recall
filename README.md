# scroll-of-recall
WIP town portal mod

TODO:

- Add crafting recipes
- Implement tome
- Particles?
- Look at BowItem for how to make it "pull back"

One texture is adapted from the excellent Malcolm Riley's unused-textures repository, namely:

    The "book_scroll_blank" and "book_scroll_written" textures.
