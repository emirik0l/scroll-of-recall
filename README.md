# Scroll of Recall

Intended as a companion for mods like [Waystones](https://github.com/TwelveIterationMods/Waystones), this mod allows you to create scrolls and tomes that can be bound to a specific location. No Forge port planned.

A **Scroll of Recall** is a single-use item. Bind it to a location, then use it to *recall* yourself there. When you're done, use it again to *return* to the place you recalled from.

The **Tome of Recall** is exactly the same, but you can use it again and again. Bind it to a location once, then you can *recall* and *return* as much as you want.

Because the tome is meant to be reused, you might find that you want to change the location it's bound to. To do so, simply unbind it by adding some more pages:
